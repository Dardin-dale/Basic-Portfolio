          Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Working it up and down, back and forth. Water's like me. It's laaazy ... 
          Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things

          This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Just a happy little shadow that lives in there. We don't really know where this goes - and I'm not sure we really care.
          If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. You can do anything your heart can imagine.
